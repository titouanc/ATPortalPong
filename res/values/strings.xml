    <string name="description">wePong is a quasi-sports game that simulates table tennis for multiple players.
        The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left side of the screen, and can compete against either a computer controlled opponent or another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side.
        Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth.
        The aim is for a player to earn more points than the opponents; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
        The ball can be pushed to another player using a portal. A portal is a link to the field of another player, it can transmits balls and powerups.
        Portals of opponents will appear as soon as they are playing the game on the same wireless network (i.e. using P2P technology).
